II: 
the two audio effect nodes i added were Treble And Bass

III:
the class name is just Sprite and i made one called spriteParams1 and spriteParams2, 
they are both circles with 3 layers of colors that take the audio frequency/wavelength to pulsate with the music

IV:
in av-data.json i put in the x and y coordinates for the sprites, 
along with the RGB Values for the inner and outer layers.

V:
i did the bare minimum and changed some colors because im talentless. 
so i would give myself a 0% becuase it is blatantly obvious that i lack the talent to make something impressive.
